Matching the Innovation and Technology Survey EDIT 2017-2018 (acronym in Spanish) with Annual Manufacturing Survey 2018 (EAM), we analyze the relationship between the performance and management at firm level for Colombia in 2018. The management is a driver of variation in the productivity, the investment on research, development and innovation (RDi) and intellectual property registers. Also, we find a statistically significant relationship between the management competence and the number of export destinations, products and export revenues,mainly in products with greater complexity. Finally, these findings are discussed, highlighting the high profitability for companies to improve their capacities and their public policy implications.

\section{Introduction}

\section{Measuring Management}

The Management and Organizational Practices Survey was incorporated for the first time in EDIT 2017 2018 (Innovation and Technology Survey in Colombia for Manufacturing Sector) and published with anonymous data on the website of the Colombian Institute of Statistics (DANE). The EDIT included 16 management
questions with two basic areas, which are supported on the idea of the continuous improvement. For our regressions, we aggregate those 16 questions into a single measure, which is called the management score. This score is the unweighted average, where the answer to each question is measured on a scale from 0 to 1.

For our regressions, we aggregate those 16 questions into a single measure, which is called the management score. This score is the unweighted average, where the answer to each question is measured on a scale from 0 to 1, where o is the worst option and 1 the best. Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics of the successful merge between EDIT and EAM, and some characteristics at the signature level. In cases where the firm has
more than one establishment, the information is added. For our analysis, we use data with at least eleven non-missing responses to the management questions that also have positive values for outcomes and inputs
of the firm.

According to Bloom(2019) the average U.S Management score (1-16 questions) is 0.615, the non-incentives (1-8) is 0.643 and the incentives (9-16) is 0.583.The following histogram shows the distribution for management score (16 questions) for Colombia and the United States, using the merge between EDIT and EAM with 6,034 observations. It plots the overlapping histogram of firm management scores for Colombia (2018) and the United States (2010) according to Bloom (2019). While the Colombian management score (from 1 to 16 questions) was 0.37, for the U.S was 0.61, which implies that the distribution of Colombia is skewed to the left compared to the United States.

The histogram below shows the distribution for management score (16 questions). As you can see, the distribution is skewed to the left, where the total number of observations is 7,529 in EDIT. This histogram includes all observations with at least 11 non-missing responses to management questions.

Figure 2 shows a positive correlation between Management score with the average of value added per employee, exports, investment on research, development and innovation, intellectual registers and wage per employee.

\section{Management and Performance}

We divide the performance into four groups of dependent variables: a) productivity: production, sales, value added, total factor productivity b) Innovation: investment on research, development and innovation (RDi) and intellectual properties register c) market competition: management score d) trade: exports, imports, number of products sold abroad, destinations, destination-product pairs, exports over product destination pairs and exports at top destination-product.

We investigate whether management competence is correlated with those measures of performance. We do not attribute a causal interpretation to the results, instead, it replicates the most of regression from Bloom (2019) and Manova (2020), which allows compare coefficients between Colombia and the United States.

\textbf{Productivity}
We start by running a basic regression of labor productivity (measured as log(output/employee)) on management score in the Appendix, where the first column is calculated with industry fixed effects, the second with location fixed effects and the third without fixed effects. This is repeated for 4 to 6 and 7 to 9 columns, with dependent variable log (sales/employees) and profit/sales, respectively.

\textbf{Innovation}
We explore linkages between innovation variables with management practices. In particular, we use the investment and intellectual registers and regress them on Management Score. The Appendix shows the regressions, indicating a strong connection of those variables with the management competence.

\textbf{Market competition}
We specify the possible links between trade liberalization and firm level productivity. Using the firm level measures of Total Factor Productivity, we estimate  the competitive pressure using the China Import Share, where its sign is negative (Appendix).

\textbf{Trade}
We examine the relationship between firms’ management practices and export performance, testing four propositions:

Proposition 1: Better managed firms are more likely to export.
Proposition 2: Better managed firms export more products to more destination markets and earn
higher export revenues
Proposition 3: The management is more important determinant in heterogeneous industries than homogeneous
Proposition 4: Better management exporters reduce the effect of geographic distance on a gravity equation approach.

\subsubsection{Semi-elasticities}
Using the column 1 from Table Firm Management Scores and Performance (1) - Appendix, we find a highly significant coefficient of 0,24, suggesting that whether other variables remain constant, a point increase in our management score from bottom to top group, in other words, from percentile 25 to 75, is associated with a 0.24 * (0.504-0.231): 6.55\% increase in labor productivity. 
The Table "Semi-elasticity from bottom to top" shows the changes in output,value added, exports, products and destinations when increasing the Management Score.

\subsection{Management and Productivity}

Suppose that the firm production function is:

$$Y_{i} = A_{i}K_{i}^{\alpha}L_{i}^{\beta}I^{\gamma}e^{\delta M_{i}}e^{\mu X_{i}} + \varepsilon_{i}$$

Where $Y_{i}$:Production of firm i
$A_{i}$: Total factor productivity (Excluding Management Practices)
$K_{i}$:Fixed assets at final of 2018
$L_{i}$:Labor inputs: the total number of employees of firm i
$I_{i}$:Intermediate inputs
$X_{i}$:Vector of additional factors: the percent of staff with college degree
$M_{i}$: Management score (1-16)

Dividing by labor and taking logs we can rewrite this in a form to estimate on the
data:

$$log\frac{Y_{i}}{L_{i}} = \alpha log\frac{K_{i}}{L_{i}} + \gamma log \frac{I_{i}}{L_{i}} + (\alpha+ \beta  +\gamma)log L_{i} +\delta M_{i} + \mu X_{i} + u_{i} $$
